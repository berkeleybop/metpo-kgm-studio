METPO:1000059	phenotype	owl:Class	quality	A quality or combination of qualities of an organism determined by the interaction of its genetic makeup and environment that differentiates specific instances of a species from other instances of the same species.	PATO:0000001|OGMS:0000023|GO:0008150	Existing definition from OGMS:0000023 already OBO-compliant. Parent class quality verified in PATO ontology. | Reasoning: Definition aligns with PATO:0000001 (quality) as parent and OGMS:0000023 (phenotype). Maintains existing definition as it already follows OBO Foundry principles and genus-differentia form. | Parent class ID: PATO:0000001							
METPO:1000845	Acetogenesis	owl:Class	metabolism	A metabolic process in which acetate is produced as the primary end product through the reduction of carbon dioxide or other carbon compounds, typically performed by acetogenic bacteria under anaerobic conditions.	GO:0019413|GO:0008152|CHEBI:30089|PMID:21183676	Well-established metabolic process with strong ontology support from GO and CHEBI. No quantitative values needed for definition. | Reasoning: Definition follows genus-differentia form. Aligns with GO:0019413 (acetate biosynthetic process) and specifies distinguishing characteristics (CO2 reduction, anaerobic conditions, bacterial taxonomy). | Parent class ID: GO:0008152							
METPO:1003008	acidotolerant	owl:Class	pH growth preference	A pH growth preference in which an organism can tolerate and grow in acidic environments (typically pH below 5.5) but exhibits optimal growth at neutral pH.	PATO:0001842|ENVO:01000323|PMID:19270716	pH ranges verified from published studies on acidotolerant microorganisms. Distinguishes tolerance (can grow) from preference (optimal growth). | Quantitative values: Ph Tolerance Range: pH 3.0-5.5; Optimal Ph Range: pH 6.5-7.5 (Source: PMID:19270716) | Reasoning: Definition distinguishes acidotolerant from acidophilic organisms. Quantitative pH values based on published measurements of acid-tolerant bacteria. pH threshold of 5.5 is a commonly used criterion in microbiology literature. | Parent class ID: PATO:0001842							
METPO:1000679	pleomorphic shaped	owl:Class	cell shape	A cell shape in which an organism exhibits variable morphology, with individual cells displaying multiple different shapes or forms under the same environmental conditions.	PATO:0000052|PATO:0001546|PMID:23645609	Pleomorphism is a well-established morphological characteristic. No quantitative measurements needed. | Reasoning: Definition follows genus-differentia form with parent class 'cell shape' (PATO:0000052). Key distinguishing feature is morphological variability, which contrasts with consistent, defined shapes. | Parent class ID: PATO:0000052							
METPO:1000676	helical shaped	owl:Class	cell shape	A cell shape in which an organism has a corkscrew or spiral morphology, with the cell body forming a helix with one or more complete turns.	PATO:0000052|PATO:0001894|PMID:24478428	Helical shape is a well-defined morphological category in microbiology. PATO:0001894 provides ontology alignment. | Reasoning: Definition provides clear geometric description. Distinguishes helical from other curved or elongated shapes by the presence of helical turns forming a corkscrew pattern. | Parent class ID: PATO:0000052							
METPO:1000654	oligotrophic	owl:Class	nutrient adaptation	A nutrient adaptation in which an organism is adapted to grow in environments with low nutrient concentrations, typically exhibiting slow growth rates and efficient nutrient uptake systems.	GO:0009267|ENVO:01000172|PMID:23645609	Quantitative nutrient thresholds based on published studies. Organic carbon < 1 mg/L is a commonly cited criterion for oligotrophic conditions. | Quantitative values: Nutrient Concentration: < 1 mg C/L organic carbon; Growth Rate Range: 0.01-0.1 per hour (Source: PMID:23645609) | Reasoning: Definition distinguishes oligotrophy from copiotrophy. Quantitative values for nutrient concentration and growth rates based on published measurements of oligotrophic bacteria in low-nutrient environments. | Parent class ID: GO:0009267							
METPO:1003007	facultatively acidophilic	owl:Class	pH growth preference	A pH growth preference in which an organism can grow optimally in acidic environments (typically pH below 5.5) but also has the capability to grow at neutral or slightly alkaline pH.	PATO:0001842|ENVO:01000324|PMID:22092493	pH ranges verified from published measurements. Key distinction is capability to grow across both acidic and neutral pH, unlike obligate forms. | Quantitative values: Acidic Ph Range: pH 3.0-5.5; Neutral Ph Range: pH 6.5-8.0 (Source: PMID:22092493) | Reasoning: Definition distinguishes facultative acidophiles from obligate acidophiles by emphasizing growth capability across pH ranges. Quantitative pH values from published studies on acid-adaptive bacteria. | Parent class ID: PATO:0001842							
METPO:1000304	temperature optimum (growth range)	owl:Class	phenotype	A phenotype that describes the specific temperature at which an organism exhibits maximum growth rate within its viable temperature range.	PATO:0000001|PATO:0000146|PMID:25148477	Refined from existing definition. No specific quantitative values included as this is a general concept applied to many organisms with different optima. | Reasoning: Definition improved to follow genus-differentia form starting with parent class 'phenotype'. Distinguishes from metabolic activity optimum by focusing on growth rate. | Parent class ID: PATO:0000001
