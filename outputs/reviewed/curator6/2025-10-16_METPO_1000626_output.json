  "notes": "The definition follows OBO Foundry principles by using genus-differentia form. The primary source (PMID:26085667) is a highly cited 2015 review in Journal of Experimental Biology by Dietmar Kültz, a recognized expert in osmoregulation and salinity stress. While this review focuses on fish, the fundamental definition of stenohaline applies across all organisms. The second source provides context for microbial halophily, and the third is a classic review on bacterial salinity tolerance. All three sources support the core concept that stenohaline organisms can tolerate only a narrow range of salinity concentrations."
