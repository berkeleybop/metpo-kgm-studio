  "class_label": "hydrogenotrophic",
  "proposed_definition": "A trophic type in which molecular hydrogen (H₂) serves as the primary electron donor for energy generation in chemotrophic metabolism.",
  "confidence": "high",
  "reasoning": "This definition follows genus-differentia form by identifying hydrogenotrophic as a type of trophic classification, then specifying the distinguishing characteristic (use of H₂ as electron donor). It avoids circularity, clearly differentiates from other trophic types (e.g., organotrophic, lithotrophic using other inorganic compounds), and accurately reflects established microbiological usage. Hydrogenotrophy is a key metabolic trait in many archaea and bacteria, particularly methanogens and sulfate reducers.",
