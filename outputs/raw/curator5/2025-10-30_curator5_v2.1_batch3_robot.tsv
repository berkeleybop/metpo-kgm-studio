METPO:1002001	Fe(III)-dependent methane oxidation	owl:Class	Metal and metalloid respiration	A metal and metalloid respiration process in which methane is oxidized using ferric iron (Fe(III)) as the terminal electron acceptor, resulting in the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) under anaerobic conditions.	GO:0015671|CHEBI:29034|CHEBI:16183|PMID:16820507	Well-documented anaerobic process. Fe(III) reduction coupled to methane oxidation is a specialized metabolic pathway. | Reasoning: Definition specifies parent class (metal respiration), unique substrate (methane), and electron acceptor (Fe(III)). Distinguishes this process by its specific substrate-acceptor pairing under anaerobic conditions. | Parent class ID: GO:0015671							
METPO:1000686	vibrio shaped	owl:Class	cell shape	A cell shape in which an organism has a curved rod or comma-like morphology, characterized by a short curved cylindrical form with a single arc.	PATO:0000052|PATO:0001933|PMID:24478428	Classic morphological category named after Vibrio genus. Single arc distinguishes from helical/spiral shapes with multiple turns. | Quantitative values: Length Range: 1.0-3.0 μm; Width Range: 0.3-0.8 μm; Curvature Angle: 20-120 degrees (Source: PMID:24478428) | Reasoning: Definition distinguishes vibrio shape from other curved forms (like spirals) by specifying comma-like form with single curve rather than multiple turns. Quantitative measurements from published vibrio morphology studies. | Parent class ID: PATO:0000052							
METPO:1000648	lithoheterotrophic	owl:Class	trophic type	A trophic type in which an organism obtains energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds while using organic compounds as the primary carbon source for biosynthesis.	GO:0042821|GO:0006091|PMID:16933922	Important trophic category combining inorganic energy source with organic carbon source. No quantitative values needed for general concept. | Reasoning: Definition clearly specifies both energy source (inorganic compounds = litho-) and carbon source (organic compounds = hetero-). Distinguishes from chemoorganotrophy, photoautotrophy, and other trophic combinations. | Parent class ID: GO:0006091							
METPO:1000801	Aerobic respiration	owl:Class	respiration	A respiration process in which molecular oxygen serves as the terminal electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, generating ATP through oxidative phosphorylation with water as the final product.	GO:0009060|GO:0045333|CHEBI:15379|PMID:23645609	Fundamental metabolic process with clear ontology alignment to GO:0009060. Water production distinguishes from anaerobic processes. | Reasoning: Definition distinguishes aerobic respiration from other respiration types by specifying oxygen as terminal electron acceptor and describing key outcome (ATP via oxidative phosphorylation, water production). | Parent class ID: GO:0045333							
METPO:1000628	extremely halophilic	owl:Class	halophily preference	A halophily preference in which an organism requires very high salt concentrations (typically 15-30% NaCl or higher) for optimal growth and cannot grow at salt concentrations below approximately 12%.	PATO:0001655|ENVO:01000325|CHEBI:26710|PMID:22092493	NaCl percentages based on published studies of extreme halophiles. 15-30% is standard range cited for extreme halophiles, distinguishing from moderate halophiles (3-15%). | Quantitative values: Optimal Nacl Range: 15-30% (w/v); Minimum Nacl Requirement: 12% (w/v) (Source: PMID:22092493) | Reasoning: Definition distinguishes extreme halophiles from moderate halophiles by specifying high salt requirement and inability to grow at lower concentrations. Quantitative values from published halophile physiology studies. | Parent class ID: PATO:0001655							
METPO:1000626	stenohaline	owl:Class	halophily preference	A halophily preference in which an organism can tolerate only a narrow range of salt concentrations and cannot adapt to significant changes in salinity.	PATO:0001655|ENVO:01000326|PMID:22092493	Contrasts with euryhaline (wide salinity tolerance). Tolerance range indicates narrow adaptation window around optimal salinity. | Quantitative values: Salinity Tolerance Range: ±2-5% NaCl from optimum (Source: PMID:22092493) | Reasoning: Definition distinguishes stenohaline from euryhaline organisms by emphasizing narrow salinity tolerance range and inability to adapt to varying salt concentrations. Quantitative range from published osmotic tolerance studies. | Parent class ID: PATO:0001655							
METPO:1000646	hydrogenotrophic	owl:Class	trophic type	A trophic type in which an organism utilizes molecular hydrogen (H₂) as the primary electron donor and energy source, typically with carbon dioxide as the carbon source.	GO:0019645|CHEBI:18276|GO:0006091|PMID:23580231	Important in many environments including methanogenic ecosystems. H₂ is specific electron donor distinguishing this from other lithotrophic types. | Reasoning: Definition specifies hydrogenotrophy by use of H₂ as electron donor, distinguishing from other lithotrophic types by substrate specificity. Often coupled with CO₂ fixation. | Parent class ID: GO:0006091							
METPO:1000658	photolithotrophic	owl:Class	trophic type	A trophic type in which an organism uses light as the energy source and oxidizes inorganic compounds as electron donors, with carbon dioxide as the primary carbon source for biosynthesis.	GO:0009773|GO:0015979|GO:0006091|PMID:23580231	Classic trophic type found in cyanobacteria and some proteobacteria. Combination of light energy with inorganic donors/carbon is key distinguishing feature. | Reasoning: Definition distinguishes photolithotrophy by combination of light energy, inorganic electron donors, and inorganic carbon source. Sets it apart from photoorganotrophy and chemolithotrophy. | Parent class ID: GO:0006091							
METPO:1000697	gram stain	owl:Class	phenotype	A phenotype determined by the differential staining response of bacterial cells to the Gram staining procedure, reflecting differences in cell wall structure and composition, with gram-positive cells retaining crystal violet dye and gram-negative cells appearing pink after counterstaining.	PATO:0000001|PATO:0002231|GO:0009274|PMID:24478428	Fundamental microbiological phenotype. Staining difference reflects peptidoglycan layer thickness and membrane structure differences. | Reasoning: Definition explains gram stain as phenotype while describing underlying basis (cell wall structure) and observable outcome (staining pattern). Follows OBO principles by linking observable trait to biological basis. | Parent class ID: PATO:0000001
