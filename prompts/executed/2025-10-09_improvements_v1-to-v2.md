# Prompt Template Improvements: Version 1.0 → Version 2.0

**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Curator:** curator5  
**Original Template:** `prompts/templates/definition-generation.md` (v1.0)  
**Improved Template:** `prompts/executed/2025-10-09_definition-generation_v2_improved.md` (v2.0)  

---

## Executive Summary

Version 2.0 of the definition generation prompt template represents a significant enhancement based on practical experience with curator5's assignment of 26 METPO terms. The improvements address real-world challenges encountered during batch definition generation, add domain-specific guidance for microbiology concepts, and incorporate validation mechanisms to ensure higher quality outputs.

## Detailed Improvements

### 1. Batch Processing Capability ⭐ CRITICAL

**Problem in v1.0:**
- Template only supported single-term processing
- Curator5 had 26 terms to process
- Required either 26 separate LLM calls or manual prompt adaptation

**Solution in v2.0:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "curator": "curator5",
    "generation_date": "2025-10-09",
    "total_definitions": 26
  },
  "definitions": [
    { /* term 1 */ },
    { /* term 2 */ }
  ]
}
```

**Impact:** 
- Enables processing multiple terms in one API call
- Maintains consistency across related terms
- Reduces processing time and cost
- Provides structured metadata for tracking

---

### 2. Common Mistakes Section ⭐ CRITICAL

**Problem in v1.0:**
- Only showed positive examples
- LLMs often made predictable errors (circularity, wrong patterns)
- No explicit guidance on what to avoid

**Solution in v2.0:**
Added clear ❌/✅ comparisons for 4 common error types:

1. **Circular Definitions**
   - ❌ Bad: "Methanogenesis is a process of producing methane by methanogens"
   - ✅ Good: "A metabolic process in which methane is produced..."

2. **Vague Definitions**
   - ❌ Bad: "A cell shape found in some bacteria"
   - ✅ Good: "A cell shape in which an organism has a spherical or nearly spherical morphology..."

3. **Wrong Patterns**
   - ❌ Bad: "Acetogenesis produces acetate through reduction of CO2"
   - ✅ Good: "A metabolic process in which acetate is produced..."

4. **Missing Distinguishing Features**
   - ❌ Bad: "A type of respiration"
   - ✅ Good: "A respiration process in which molecular oxygen serves as the terminal electron acceptor..."

**Impact:**
- Reduced errors in generated definitions
- Faster review process for curators
- Better adherence to OBO Foundry principles

---

### 3. METPO-Specific Domain Guidelines ⭐ CRITICAL

**Problem in v1.0:**
- Generic ontology guidance only
- No specific requirements for microbiology concepts
- LLM had to infer what details to include

**Solution in v2.0:**
Added detailed guidelines for 5 term categories commonly found in METPO:

#### 3.1 Metabolic Processes
**Requirements:**
- Specify substrates and products
- Specify conditions (aerobic/anaerobic)
- Specify electron donors/acceptors
- Mention taxonomic restrictions when relevant

**Example Terms:** Acetogenesis, Methanogenesis, Aerobic respiration, Disproportionation

#### 3.2 Morphological Terms
**Requirements:**
- Provide geometric/spatial description
- Distinguish from similar shapes
- Be specific about characteristics

**Example Terms:** coccus shaped, helical shaped, pleomorphic shaped, ellipsoidal

#### 3.3 Growth Preferences
**Requirements:**
- Specify quantitative ranges (pH 5.5, 15-30% NaCl)
- Distinguish obligate vs. facultative
- Define tolerance vs. preference

**Example Terms:** acidotolerant, obligately acidophilic, extremely halophilic, oligotrophic

#### 3.4 Trophic Types
**Requirements:**
- Clearly state BOTH energy source AND carbon source
- Energy: Light (photo-) or chemical (chemo-)
- Carbon: Organic (organo-/hetero-) or inorganic (litho-/auto-)
- Avoid ambiguity

**Example Terms:** chemoorganotrophic, photolithotrophic, lithoheterotrophic, hydrogenotrophic

#### 3.5 Phenotypic Traits
**Requirements:**
- Describe observable characteristic
- Mention underlying mechanism when relevant
- Distinguish from related traits

**Example Terms:** motility, gram stain, cell shape

**Impact:**
- Definitions now consistently include critical details
- Better alignment with microbiological standards
- Clearer distinction between similar terms

---

### 4. Enhanced Source Requirements ⭐ IMPORTANT

**Problem in v1.0:**
- Vague guidance: "suggested_sources"
- No quality criteria specified
- No minimum requirements

**Solution in v2.0:**

**Acceptable Sources (prioritized):**
1. Peer-reviewed journal articles (PMID:12345678)
2. Authoritative textbooks (ISBN:9781555819675)
3. Published reviews (DOI:10.1234/example)
4. Official manuals (CDC, Bergey's Manual)

**NOT Acceptable:**
- Wikipedia or general encyclopedias
- Non-peer-reviewed blogs/websites
- Unpublished materials

**Minimum:** 2-3 credible sources per definition

**Impact:**
- Higher quality source citations
- Easier verification for curators
- More authoritative definitions

---

### 5. Self-Check Validation Mechanism ⭐ IMPORTANT

**Problem in v1.0:**
- No quality control mechanism
- LLM would submit without self-review
- More errors reached curator review stage

**Solution in v2.0:**

Added 10-point checklist LLM must verify:
- [ ] Definition starts with parent class (genus-differentia form)
- [ ] Term being defined does NOT appear in its own definition
- [ ] Distinguishing characteristics are specific and measurable
- [ ] Definition clear to microbiologist without additional context
- [ ] At least 2 credible sources provided
- [ ] Confidence level matches reasoning quality
- [ ] For metabolic terms: substrates/products specified
- [ ] For morphological terms: geometric description provided
- [ ] For preference terms: quantitative ranges included
- [ ] For trophic types: both energy and carbon sources stated

**Impact:**
- Better quality control before curator review
- Fewer iterations needed
- LLM "thinks through" requirements

---

### 6. Comprehensive Worked Examples ⭐ IMPORTANT

**Problem in v1.0:**
- Only 1 example (methanogenesis)
- Single term type (metabolic process)
- Limited demonstration of edge cases

**Solution in v2.0:**

Added 4 complete examples covering different term types:

1. **Example 1: Metabolic Process** (Methanogenesis)
   - Shows substrate/product specification
   - Demonstrates taxonomic restrictions
   - Includes condition requirements

2. **Example 2: Cell Shape** (coccus shaped)
   - Shows geometric description
   - Demonstrates sibling distinction
   - Classic morphology term

3. **Example 3: pH Growth Preference** (obligately acidophilic)
   - Shows quantitative ranges
   - Demonstrates obligate vs. facultative distinction
   - Contrasts with sibling terms

4. **Example 4: Trophic Type** (lithoheterotrophic)
   - Shows energy AND carbon source specification
   - Demonstrates complex term breakdown
   - Contrasts with related trophic strategies

Each example includes:
- Complete input data
- Full JSON output
- Detailed reasoning
- Source citations
- Notes on edge cases

**Impact:**
- LLM has better pattern recognition

### 7. Special Cases Handling ⭐ MODERATE

**Problem in v1.0:**
- No guidance for edge cases
- Uncertainty with broad terms or multiple parents
- No guidance on taxonomic restrictions

**Solution in v2.0:**

Added explicit guidance for 4 special cases:

1. **Broad Parent Classes** (e.g., "phenotype", "metabolism")
   - May be intentionally broad
   - Should still specify what class encompasses

2. **Terms with Multiple Parents**
   - Reference most specific/relevant parent
   - Can mention others in notes

3. **Taxonomically Restricted Terms**
   - Include restriction in definition
   - Example: "exclusively performed by methanogenic archaea"

4. **Overlapping Concepts**
   - Clearly distinguish from siblings
   - Specify key differences

**Impact:**
- Handles complex ontology relationships better
- Reduces curator questions
- More comprehensive definitions

---

### 8. Confidence Level Definitions ⭐ MODERATE

**Problem in v1.0:**
- Confidence levels mentioned but not defined
- Inconsistent application
- Unclear what each level means

**Solution in v2.0:**

**Explicit Definitions:**
- **high**: Scientifically accurate, follows all OBO principles, strong source support, clearly distinguishes from siblings
- **medium**: Accurate but may be broad, some source support, could benefit from refinement
- **low**: Needs significant work, limited sources, may have ambiguity or circularity

**Impact:**
- More consistent confidence ratings
- Better communication of definition quality
- Helps prioritize curator review efforts

---

### 9. Enhanced Output Format ⭐ MODERATE

**Problem in v1.0:**
- Basic JSON structure
- No field for additional context
- Limited metadata

**Solution in v2.0:**

Added optional fields:
```json
{
  "class_id": "METPO:1234567",
  "class_label": "term",
  "parent_class": "parent",  // ← Explicit parent field
  "proposed_definition": "...",
  "confidence": "high",
  "reasoning": "...",
  "suggested_sources": [],
  "notes": "..."  // ← New field for context
}
```

Plus metadata wrapper for batch processing:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "curator": "curator5",
    "generation_date": "2025-10-09",
    "ontology": "METPO",
    "description": "...",
    "total_definitions": 26
  },
  "definitions": [...]
}
```

**Impact:**
- Better tracking and provenance
- Space for nuanced commentary
- Matches actual workflow needs

---

### 10. Improved Prompt Pattern Guidance ⭐ MODERATE

**Problem in v1.0:**
- Single pattern shown: "An [parent class] that..."
- Rigid interpretation

**Solution in v2.0:**

Multiple acceptable patterns:
- "A [parent class] that [characteristics]"
- "A [parent class] in which [characteristics]"
- "An [parent class] characterized by [characteristics]"

**Examples:**
- "A metabolic process in which acetate is produced..."
- "A cell shape characterized by spherical morphology..."
- "A pH growth preference in which an organism requires..."

**Impact:**
- More natural language variety
- Better fit for different term types
- Maintains genus-differentia principle

---

### 11. Execution Documentation ⭐ MINOR

**Problem in v1.0:**
- Template only, no execution records
- No tracking of actual usage

**Solution in v2.0:**

Added execution log section:
```markdown
## Execution Log

**Date Executed:** 2025-10-09
**Curator:** curator5
