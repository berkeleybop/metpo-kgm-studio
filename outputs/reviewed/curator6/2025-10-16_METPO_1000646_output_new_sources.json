  "notes": "All three sources provide strong support for the definition. The Albina et al. (2019) review is particularly valuable as it focuses specifically on hydrogenotrophic processes and explicitly defines hydrogen as an electron donor in chemotrophic metabolism. The Kurth et al. (2020) review provides detailed mechanistic understanding of hydrogenotrophy in methanogenic archaea. The Brock textbook (Madigan et al. 2018) is the gold standard reference for microbial metabolism and provides authoritative coverage of hydrogen oxidation and chemolithotrophy. Together, these sources cover both bacterial and archaeal hydrogenotrophy across diverse metabolic contexts (denitrification, methanogenesis, aerobic respiration)."
