    "class_id": "METPO:1001102",
    "class_label": "biosafety level 1",
    "proposed_definition": "A biosafety level that is applicable to work with well-characterized biological agents that are not known to consistently cause disease in healthy adult humans and present minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment.",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "This definition follows the genus-differentia form starting with the parent class 'biosafety level'. It distinguishes BSL-1 from higher biosafety levels by specifying the risk characteristics: agents not known to cause disease in healthy adults and minimal hazard potential. This aligns with CDC/NIH biosafety guidelines and is appropriate for classifying microbial organisms in METPO.",
