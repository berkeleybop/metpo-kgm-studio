    "class_label": "spore shaped",
    "proposed_definition": "A cell shape in which the cell exhibits the characteristic morphology of a dormant spore, typically being smaller, more spherical or oval, and more refractile than vegetative cells of the same organism.",
    "confidence": "medium",
    "reasoning": "This definition follows the genus-differentia form starting with the parent class 'cell shape'. It distinguishes spore shape from vegetative cell shapes by specifying characteristics of dormant spores (reduced size, spherical/oval morphology, refractility). However, confidence is medium because 'spore shaped' is somewhat unusual as a cell shape categoryâ€”spores are a cell type/state rather than purely a shape. The definition attempts to capture the morphological features that distinguish spores.",
