    "class_label": "spindle shaped",
    "proposed_definition": "A cell shape in which the cell is fusiform, being widest at the center and tapering symmetrically toward both pointed or rounded ends, resembling a spindle or football.",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "This definition follows the genus-differentia form starting with the parent class 'cell shape'. It distinguishes spindle shape from other cell shapes by specifying the characteristic fusiform morphology with central widening and tapering ends. This morphology is found in some archaea and bacteria and is distinctly different from rod-shaped, oval, or other cell shapes.",
