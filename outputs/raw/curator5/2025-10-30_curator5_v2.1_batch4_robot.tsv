METPO:1001104	biosafety level 3	owl:Class	biosafety level	A biosafety level classification for organisms that can cause serious or potentially lethal disease through inhalation or other routes, requiring specialized containment facilities with controlled access, directional airflow, and strict safety protocols.	NCIT:C93220|CDC-BMBL|WHO-LBM	Standardized biosafety classification from CDC and WHO guidelines. BSL-3 facilities required for pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Yersinia pestis. | Reasoning: Definition specifies risk characteristics (serious/lethal disease, inhalation transmission) and required safety measures. Distinguishes BSL-3 from BSL-2 (moderate risk) and BSL-4 (extreme risk). | Parent class ID: NCIT:C93220							
METPO:1000333	NaCl optimum	owl:Class	phenotype	A phenotype that describes the specific concentration of sodium chloride at which a microorganism exhibits maximum growth rate and metabolic efficiency.	PATO:0000001|PATO:0000033|CHEBI:26710|PMID:22092493	Refined from existing definition. Related to halophily preferences but specifically defines optimal concentration point rather than tolerance range. No organism-specific values included. | Reasoning: Definition refined to follow genus-differentia form. Clearly identifies as phenotype and specifies both growth and metabolic aspects. Related to but distinct from halophily preferences. | Parent class ID: PATO:0000001							
METPO:1000666	cell shape	owl:Class	phenotype	A phenotype that describes the characteristic three-dimensional morphological form of a microbial cell, determined by the cell wall structure, cytoskeletal elements, and environmental factors.	GO:0008360|PATO:0000052|PATO:0000001|PMID:24478428	High-level category serving as parent for specific shape terms. Cell wall and cytoskeletal elements are key determinants of bacterial shape. | Reasoning: Definition establishes cell shape as high-level phenotypic category while indicating structural determinants. Appropriate for parent class of specific shape terms (coccus, bacillus, helical, etc.). | Parent class ID: PATO:0000001							
METPO:1000844	Methanogenesis	owl:Class	metabolism	A metabolic process in which methane is produced as the primary end product through the reduction of carbon-containing compounds such as carbon dioxide, formate, methanol, or acetate, exclusively performed by methanogenic archaea under strictly anaerobic conditions.	GO:0015948|CHEBI:16183|NCBITaxon:2172|GO:0008152|PMID:23645609	Synonyms like 'carbonate respiration' emphasize CO2 reduction pathway. Taxonomic restriction to archaea is critical distinguishing feature. Temperature range 0-110°C spans from cold environments to hydrothermal vents. | Quantitative values: Temperature Range: 0-110°C; Optimal Ph Range: 6.5-7.8 (Source: PMID:23645609) | Reasoning: Definition distinguishes methanogenesis from other metabolic processes by: (1) unique end product (methane), (2) specific substrates, (3) taxonomic restriction to archaea, and (4) obligate anaerobic nature. Temperature range spans psychrophilic to hyperthermophilic methanogens. | Parent class ID: GO:0008152							
METPO:1003006	obligately acidophilic	owl:Class	pH growth preference	A pH growth preference in which an organism requires acidic conditions (typically pH below 5.5) for growth and cannot grow at neutral pH.	PATO:0001842|ENVO:01000322|PMID:17223624	Obligate nature is critical - these organisms fail to grow at neutral pH. pH 5.5 threshold is commonly used criterion. Examples include Acidithiobacillus, Sulfolobus. | Quantitative values: Optimal Ph Range: pH 1.0-5.0; Growth Ph Limit: pH 5.5-6.0 (Source: PMID:17223624) | Reasoning: Definition distinguishes obligate acidophiles from facultative forms by emphasizing absolute requirement for acidic conditions and inability to grow at neutral pH. Quantitative pH values from published acidophile studies. | Parent class ID: PATO:0001842							
METPO:1000673	ellipsoidal	owl:Class	cell shape	A cell shape in which an organism has an oval or ellipse-like morphology, elongated along one axis with rounded ends, intermediate between spherical and rod-shaped.	PATO:0000052|PATO:0002318|PMID:24478428	Length-to-width ratio 1.5-3.0 distinguishes from cocci (ratio ~1.0) and elongated rods (ratio >3.0). Measurements from published bacterial morphology studies. | Quantitative values: Length To Width Ratio: 1.5-3.0; Length Range: 1.5-4.0 μm; Width Range: 0.8-1.5 μm (Source: PMID:24478428) | Reasoning: Definition provides clear geometric description distinguishing ellipsoidal cells from both cocci (spherical) and bacilli (cylindrical rods) by oval geometry. Length-to-width ratio quantifies the elongation. | Parent class ID: PATO:0000052							
METPO:1000663	chemoorganotrophic	owl:Class	trophic type	A trophic type in which an organism obtains energy through chemical oxidation of organic compounds that also serve as the carbon source for biosynthesis.	GO:0015976|GO:0006091|PMID:23645609	Most common trophic type in bacteria and fungi. Organic compounds serve dual role as both energy and carbon source, distinguishing from mixotrophic strategies. | Reasoning: Definition distinguishes chemoorganotrophy from other trophic types by specifying both energy source (chemical oxidation of organic compounds) and role of organic compounds as carbon source. Contrasts with lithotrophic and phototrophic types. | Parent class ID: GO:0006091
