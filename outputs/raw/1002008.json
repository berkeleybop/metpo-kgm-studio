    "proposed_definition": "A nitrogen compound respiration process in which atmospheric nitrogen gas (N₂) is reduced to ammonia (NH₃) through the action of nitrogenase enzyme complex, making nitrogen available for biosynthesis.",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "This definition follows the genus-differentia form starting with the parent class 'nitrogen compound respiration'. It distinguishes nitrogen fixation from other nitrogen metabolism processes by specifying: (1) the substrate (N₂), (2) the product (NH₃), (3) the enzyme system (nitrogenase), and (4) the biological significance. The synonym 'diazotroph' confirms this refers to organisms capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen.",
