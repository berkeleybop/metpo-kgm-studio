    "proposed_definition": "A phenotype that specifies the temperature at which an organism achieves its maximum growth rate, representing the optimal point within its permissive temperature range.",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "This definition follows the genus-differentia form starting with the parent class 'phenotype'. It maintains the essence of the existing description while clarifying that this represents a specific optimal point within the broader growth range. The definition distinguishes temperature optimum from minimum/maximum temperature limits by specifying it as the point of maximum growth rate. This is a quantifiable and operationally useful phenotypic characteristic.",
