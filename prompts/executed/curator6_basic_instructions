You are helping curate definitions for the METPO (Microbial Environment and Traits Ontology) and KG-Microbe knowledge graph. Your task is to generate high-quality textual definitions that follow OBO Foundry principles.

Requirements (OBO Foundry FP-006)
Genus-Differentia Form: Definitions must follow the pattern:

"An [parent class] that [distinguishing characteristics]"
NOT: "A metabolic process..." (avoid starting with article + class name)
Definition Quality:

Must be clear, concise, and unambiguous
Must be intelligible to a biologist or microbiologist
Should reference parent classes from the ontology hierarchy
Should specify what makes this class distinct from siblings
Avoid Circularity: Do not use the term being defined in its own definition

Scientific Accuracy: Base definitions on established scientific knowledge

Input Format
For each term, you will receive:

Class ID: e.g., METPO:1234567
Class Label: e.g., "anaerobic respiration"
Parent Class(es): e.g., "cellular respiration" (METPO:1234560)
Existing Definition (if any): Current definition that may need improvement
Output Format
Provide your response as JSON:

{
  "class_id": "METPO:1234567",
  "class_label": "anaerobic respiration",
  "proposed_definition": "A cellular respiration process that occurs in the absence of oxygen, using alternative electron acceptors such as nitrate, sulfate, or carbon dioxide.",
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this definition is appropriate",
  "suggested_sources": [
    "PMID:12345678",
    "DOI:10.1234/example",
    "ISBN:1234567890"
  ]
}
Example
Input:

Class ID: METPO:0000123
Class Label: methanogenesis
Parent Class: anaerobic respiration (METPO:0000120)
Existing Definition: None
Expected Output:

{
  "class_id": "METPO:0000123",
  "class_label": "methanogenesis",
  "proposed_definition": "An anaerobic respiration process in which methane is produced as the primary metabolic end product, typically using carbon dioxide or acetic acid as terminal electron acceptors.",
  "confidence": "high",
  "reasoning": "Definition follows genus-differentia form, clearly distinguishes methanogenesis from other anaerobic respiration types by specifying methane production and typical electron acceptors.",
  "suggested_sources": [
    "PMID:15073711",
    "PMID:23645609"
  ]
}

"I'm ready to help curate definitions for METPO following OBO Foundry principles. I understand the requirements:

Genus-differentia form: "A(n) [parent class] that [distinguishing characteristics]"
Quality criteria: Clear, concise, unambiguous, intelligible to microbiologists
No circularity: Don't use the term in its own definition
Scientific accuracy: Based on established knowledge
Proper hierarchy: Reference parent classes appropriately

Please provide me with the term(s) you'd like me to define, including:

Class ID
Class Label
Parent Class(es)
Existing Definition (if any)
Any additional context about sibling classes or related terms

I'll generate definitions in the JSON format you specified, with:

Proposed definition following OBO Foundry FP-006
Confidence level (high/medium/low)
Reasoning for the definition choices
Suggested sources (PMIDs, DOIs, ISBNs where appropriate)

I'm ready when you are!"


Generating for stenohaline: 
Class ID: METPO:1000626
Class Label: stenohaline
Parent Class: halophily preference (METPO:1000629)
Existing Definition: None
