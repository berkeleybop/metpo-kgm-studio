    "proposed_definition": "A trophic type in which an organism obtains energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds and uses organic compounds as the primary carbon source for biosynthesis.",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "This definition follows the genus-differentia form starting with the parent class 'trophic type'. It distinguishes chemolithoheterotrophy from other trophic types by specifying: (1) energy source from inorganic compound oxidation (like chemolithotrophs), and (2) carbon source from organic compounds (like heterotrophs). This combination differentiates it from chemolithoautotrophs (inorganic carbon) and chemoorganoheterotrophs (organic energy source).",
