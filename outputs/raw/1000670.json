    "proposed_definition": "A cell shape in which the cell has a curved or bent cylindrical morphology that deviates from a straight axis, including comma-shaped (vibrioid), S-shaped, and spiral forms.",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "This definition follows the genus-differentia form starting with the parent class 'cell shape'. It distinguishes curved cells from straight rod-shaped cells by specifying the curved or bent axis. The inclusion of various curved forms (vibrioid, S-shaped, spiral) covers the range indicated by the bactotraits synonym 's_curved_spiral' while maintaining clarity.",
