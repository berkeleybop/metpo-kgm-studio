    "proposed_definition": "A pH growth preference in which an organism exhibits optimal growth at pH values between approximately 6.5 and 7.5, near neutral pH.",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "This definition follows the genus-differentia form starting with the parent class 'pH growth preference'. It distinguishes neutrophiles from acidophiles and alkaliphiles by specifying the characteristic pH range for optimal growth (6.5-7.5). This range represents the standard classification used in microbiology for organisms adapted to neutral pH environments. The synonyms 'neutralophile' and 'neutralophilic' confirm this classification.",
