    "proposed_definition": "A nutrient adaptation in which an organism is capable of growth and survival in environments with very low nutrient concentrations, typically exhibiting slow growth rates and efficient nutrient uptake systems.",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "This definition follows the genus-differentia form starting with the parent class 'nutrient adaptation'. It distinguishes oligotrophs from copiotrophs (prefer high nutrient concentrations) by specifying adaptation to low-nutrient environments and associated characteristics (slow growth, efficient uptake). Oligotrophs are ecologically important in nutrient-poor habitats like deep ocean waters and oligotrophic lakes.",
