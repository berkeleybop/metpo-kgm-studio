    "proposed_definition": "A phenotype that specifies the minimum and maximum concentrations of sodium chloride at which an organism can grow and maintain viability.",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "This definition follows the genus-differentia form starting with the parent class 'phenotype'. It distinguishes NaCl range from other phenotypes by specifying that it represents the permissive concentration boundaries for NaCl tolerance. The existing description mentions osmotic balance and cellular functions, but for a 'range' concept, the definition should focus on the boundaries rather than mechanisms. This definition is operationally clear for microbiologists.",
