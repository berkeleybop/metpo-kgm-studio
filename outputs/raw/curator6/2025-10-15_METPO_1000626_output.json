  "proposed_definition": "A halophily preference in which an organism can tolerate only a narrow range of salinity concentrations in its environment.",
  "confidence": "high",
  "reasoning": "Definition follows genus-differentia form by referencing the parent class 'halophily preference' and distinguishing stenohaline organisms by their narrow salinity tolerance range. This contrasts with euryhaline organisms (likely a sibling class) that tolerate broad salinity ranges. The definition is clear, follows OBO Foundry principles, and is intelligible to microbiologists.",
