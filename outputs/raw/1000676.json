    "proposed_definition": "A cell shape in which the cell forms a spiral or corkscrew-like structure with regular helical coiling along its length, typically with multiple complete turns.",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "This definition follows the genus-differentia form starting with the parent class 'cell shape'. It distinguishes helical cells from other curved shapes (vibrioid, S-shaped) by specifying the regular spiral/helical coiling pattern with multiple turns. This morphology is characteristic of organisms like Spirillum and spirochetes, representing a distinct and recognizable cell shape in microbiology.",
