METPO:1000668	coccus shaped	owl:Class	cell shape	A cell shape in which an organism has a spherical or nearly spherical morphology, with roughly equal dimensions in all directions.	PATO:0000052|PATO:0001201|PMID:24478428	Classic well-defined morphological category. Diameter range from published bacterial cell measurements. | Quantitative values: Diameter Range: 0.5-3.0 μm (Source: PMID:24478428) | Reasoning: Definition provides clear geometric description of spherical geometry with equal dimensions. Distinguishes from elongated shapes (bacillus, vibrio) or irregular shapes (pleomorphic). Diameter range based on published measurements of coccoid bacteria. | Parent class ID: PATO:0000052							
METPO:1000693	spirochete shaped	owl:Class	cell shape	A cell shape in which an organism has an elongated, tightly coiled helical morphology with periplasmic flagella (endoflagella) located between the cell wall and outer membrane, characteristic of bacteria in the phylum Spirochaetes.	PATO:0000052|PATO:0001895|NCBITaxon:203691|PMID:23645609	Periplasmic flagella (endoflagella) are defining characteristic distinguishing spirochetes from other helical bacteria. Measurements from published spirochete dimensions. | Quantitative values: Length Range: 5-250 μm; Coil Wavelength: 0.5-3.0 μm (Source: PMID:23645609) | Reasoning: Definition distinguishes spirochete shape from general helical shapes by including characteristic periplasmic flagella and taxonomic specificity to phylum Spirochaetes. Quantitative measurements from published spirochete morphology studies. | Parent class ID: PATO:0000052							
METPO:1000806	Disproportionation	owl:Class	metabolism	A metabolic process in which a single substrate simultaneously undergoes both oxidation and reduction reactions, with part of the substrate serving as the electron donor and another part serving as the electron acceptor.	GO:0008152|GO:0055114|CHEBI:33260|PMID:28331159	Well-established metabolic process. No specific quantitative values needed for definition. | Reasoning: Definition distinguishes disproportionation from other metabolic processes by its unique characteristic of simultaneous oxidation and reduction of the same substrate. Follows genus-differentia form. | Parent class ID: GO:0008152							
METPO:1000329	temperature optimum (metabolic activity)	owl:Class	biological process	A biological process phenotype that describes the specific temperature at which a microorganism exhibits maximum metabolic activity and enzyme function within its viable range.	GO:0008150|GO:0008152|PATO:0000146|PMID:25148477	Refined from existing definition. Distinct from growth rate optimum as metabolic activity can peak at different temperatures than growth. No organism-specific values included. | Reasoning: Definition distinguishes from growth optimum by emphasizing metabolic activity and enzyme function rather than growth rate. Follows genus-differentia form with biological process as parent. | Parent class ID: GO:0008150							
METPO:1000701	motility	owl:Class	phenotype	A phenotype in which an organism has the capability to move independently through its environment, typically by means of flagella, pili, gliding mechanisms, or other locomotory structures.	GO:0040011|PATO:0000001|PATO:0000708|PMID:23645609	Well-established phenotype. Speed range from published measurements of flagella-driven bacterial swimming. | Quantitative values: Swimming Speed Range: 10-100 μm/s (Source: PMID:23645609) | Reasoning: Definition specifies motility as phenotypic trait while listing various mechanisms enabling movement. Distinguishes motile from non-motile organisms. Swimming speed range from published bacterial motility studies. | Parent class ID: PATO:0000001							
METPO:1000632	autotrophic	owl:Class	trophic type	A trophic type in which an organism produces organic compounds from inorganic carbon sources (primarily carbon dioxide or bicarbonate) using energy from light (photoautotrophy) or from the oxidation of inorganic compounds (chemoautotrophy).	GO:0006730|GO:0006091|CHEBI:16526|PMID:23580231	Fundamental trophic classification. No quantitative values needed for general concept definition. | Reasoning: Definition identifies autotrophy by carbon source (inorganic carbon) and acknowledges two main energy sources. Distinguishes from heterotrophic types which use organic carbon sources. | Parent class ID: GO:0006091							
METPO:1002006	Syntrophy	owl:Class	metabolism	A metabolic process involving obligate cooperation between two or more microbial species in which the metabolism of one species is thermodynamically dependent on the removal of its products by another species.	GO:0044403|GO:0008152|PMID:27841757|PMID:15590778	Well-established metabolic interaction. Thermodynamic dependency is critical distinguishing feature from other symbiotic relationships. | Reasoning: Definition emphasizes obligate metabolic interdependence and thermodynamic coupling between species. Key distinguishing features are obligate cooperation and thermodynamic dependency. | Parent class ID: GO:0008152							
METPO:1000805	Electron transfer	owl:Class	metabolism	A metabolic process in which electrons are transferred from an electron donor to an electron acceptor, either within a single organism or between different organisms, generating energy for cellular processes.	GO:0022900|GO:0055114|CHEBI:10545|PMID:24407446	Intentionally broad definition as electron transfer underlies many specific metabolic pathways including respiration, photosynthesis, and extracellular electron transfer. Medium confidence due to breadth. | Reasoning: Definition is intentionally broad to encompass various forms including cellular respiration and extracellular electron transfer. Electron transfer is fundamental to many metabolic pathways. | Parent class ID: GO:0008152							
METPO:1000642	copiotrophic	owl:Class	nutrient adaptation	A nutrient adaptation in which an organism thrives in environments with high nutrient concentrations, typically exhibiting rapid growth rates and utilizing diverse carbon sources.	GO:0009267|ENVO:01000173|PMID:25148477	Quantitative nutrient thresholds based on published studies. Organic carbon > 10 mg/L contrasts with oligotrophic < 1 mg/L criterion. | Quantitative values: Nutrient Concentration: > 10 mg C/L organic carbon; Growth Rate Range: 0.5-2.0 per hour (Source: PMID:25148477) | Reasoning: Definition contrasts with oligotrophy by specifying adaptation to high nutrient environments and rapid growth characteristics. Quantitative values from published studies of copiotrophic bacteria. | Parent class ID: GO:0009267
