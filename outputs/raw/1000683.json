    "proposed_definition": "A cell shape in which the cell is spherical or nearly spherical, with approximately equal dimensions in all directions, also known as coccoid or coccus morphology.",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "This definition follows the genus-differentia form starting with the parent class 'cell shape'. It distinguishes spherical cells from other cell shapes by specifying the three-dimensional spherical geometry with equal dimensions. The bactotraits synonym 's_sphere' and the term 'coccus' (standard microbiological terminology) are incorporated to make the definition recognizable to microbiologists.",
